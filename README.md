# .NET_inject
  
ToDo:  
	1.  
	* find explorer PID from binary (not as argument)! (DONE)  
	* obfuscate code; (DONE)  
	* Opsec Safe injection - no RWX, but RW -> RX; (DONE)  
	2.  
	* Integrate with TikiTorch not to inject, but hollow! (DONE)  
	  Note! Need to Compile and Obfuscate TikiTorch manually!  
	3.
